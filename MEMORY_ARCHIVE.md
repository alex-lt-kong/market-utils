### 2026-06-22 — Unify pe_monitor + ai_ratios under one FastAPI app
- Built `core/` host shell with a pluggable `Module` interface and auto-discovery of
  `modules/*` exposing `MODULE`.
- Moved `pe_monitor/` → `modules/pe_monitor/` (git mv; backfill `_bootstrap` unaffected).
  Converted `app.py` → `views.py` (APIRouter); made `scheduler.py` imports relative;
  fixed dashboard `url_for(path=)`, prefixed client `fetch` calls and the manifest.
- Built `modules/ai_ratios/` from the old `ai_ratios.py` CLI: split compute (`core.py`),
  added cache + own scheduler (`cache.py`), router + Jinja dashboard. Dropped the CLI.
- Added shared auth (`SessionMiddleware` + token gate), default-disabled.
- Consolidated dependencies into a single top-level `requirements.txt` (FastAPI/uvicorn;
  dropped Flask). Verified end-to-end: landing, both modules, static, `/docs` (tagged per
  module), auth on/off, and backfill imports.
